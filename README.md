## Experiments

This is the Matlab code to  

- validate the numerical stability of our Cholesky metrics (Sec. 7.1), 
- visualize the tensor interpolation of the induced SPD metrics (Sec. 7.2).

Please run 

- `geodesic_diff.m` for the experiments on stability.

- `swelling_effects` for the experiments on tensor interpolation.
